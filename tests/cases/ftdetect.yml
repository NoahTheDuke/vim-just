# This file specifies a list of files to generate for `vim-just` filetype detection tests.
# Each list entry can have the following properties:
#
#   filename: (string) The name of the file.
#             Each occurrence of `*` will be replaced with a
#             non-empty random sequence of alphanumeric characters.
#             If not specified, the file will have a completely random alphanumeric name.
#
#   never: (string) Regex which filename must NOT match for this test case.
#
#   content: (string) The file contents.  If not specified, the file will be empty.
#
#   not_justfile: (boolean) Set this to `true` if the file specified by the other properties
#                 should **not** be detected as a justfile.
